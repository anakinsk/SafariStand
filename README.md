# SafariStand for Safari 10

SIMBL plugin for Safari.

This is a fork of the original SafariStand project, that supports macOS Sierra and Safari 10. Original project seems abandoned, so I decided to create this one to continue the project since the original does not work well with Safari 10 and the author does not seem to be accepting any pull requests.

Current version supports Safari 10 only. I probably killed the support for the other versions when I was making changes for Safari 10 and macOS Sierra. If you wish to use SafariStand with any of the older Safari versions, you can download a legacy build from the original author [here](https://github.com/hetima/SafariStand/releases).

# Issues & Contribution
I welcome and appreciate contributions from the community.

I am new to this project (actually came across it just a week ago primarily wanting the favicons), so may not be familiar with some of the features which may still be in a broken state. So if your favorite feature does not work, let me know and I'll see what I can do. Or make a fix youself and create a pull request :)

# Original Author
All credit must go to this guy actually, cause he did an amazing job putting the whole project together from scratch. I just changed a few things to adapt the module to the changes Apple did to their Safari codebase.
